# IPython notebooks for A Practical Introduction to the Simulation of Molecular Systems

IPython notebooks for examples of [A Practical Introduction to the Simulation of Molecular Systems, by Martin J. Field](http://www.cambridge.org/br/academic/subjects/chemistry/chemistry-general-interest/practical-introduction-simulation-molecular-systems-2nd-edition)

All the examples use the [pDynamo](https://sites.google.com/site/pdynamomodeling/) library. pDynamo is an open source program library that has been designed for the simulation of molecular systems using quantum chemical (QC), molecular mechanical (MM) and hybrid QC/MM potential energy functions.
